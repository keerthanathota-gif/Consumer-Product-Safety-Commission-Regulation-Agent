- **Pydantic**: Data validation and serialization
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms

## 🎯 Use Cases Enabled

### 1. **Regulatory Compliance Analysis**
- Map compliance requirements across regulations
- Identify conflicting or overlapping requirements
- Track regulatory changes and impacts

### 2. **Knowledge Discovery**
- Discover hidden relationships between regulations
- Identify regulatory patterns and trends
- Find gaps in regulatory coverage

### 3. **Enhanced Redundancy Analysis**
- Use graph traversal to find indirect redundancies
- Identify regulatory clusters with similar content
- Analyze regulatory evolution over time

### 4. **Interactive Exploration**
- Visualize regulatory structure
- Explore relationships interactively
- Search and filter regulations by various criteria

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. **Quick Start (Basic Mode)**
```bash
cd /workspace/graphiti_integration
python3 simple_test.py  # Test basic functionality
```

### 2. **Full Dashboard (Requires API Keys)**
```bash
# Add your OpenAI API key to .env file
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here" >> .env

# Launch dashboard
streamlit run graph_dashboard.py
```

### 3. **Programmatic Access**
```python
from integration_api import GraphitiIntegration

# Initialize
integration = GraphitiIntegration()

# Search regulations
results = integration.search_regulations("safety requirements")

# Get related regulations
related = integration.get_related_regulations("§ 1000.1")

# Find clusters
clusters = integration.find_regulatory_clusters()
```

## 🔑 Configuration

### Required
